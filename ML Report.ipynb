    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This project implemented machine learning methods to differentiate music between different composers. This was achieved by inspection of MIDI metadata and audio features (predominantly consisting of spectral analysis). The first two models were different versions of **Naïve Bayes** and the third was **Logistic Regression**, which gives the probability that a certain composition is composed by a certain composer.\n",
    "After passing our data through 3 algorithms, we ran multiple tests using different combinations of composers and features in order to find the combinations that gave us the highest accuracies. \n",

    "\n",
    "This project was based on a public set of classical compositions for piano. The dataset was sourced from http://www.piano-midi.de/. MIDI files were taken as the raw data and **jAudio** (http://jaudio.sourceforge.net/) was used to extract features from the MIDI. There are 127 MIDI files (datapoints) in the dataset. The size of the dataset was increased by splitting the MIDI files into 16 second samples before extracting 13 audio features per file. This gave us a total of 2514 samples.\n",

The second strategy was to split the data in the same 60% / 40% ratio but enforced equal representation for all composers in the training data.
